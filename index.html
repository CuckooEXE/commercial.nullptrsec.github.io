                <span class="company-name nullptr small">nullptr</span>&nbsp;<span class="company-name security small">security</span> builds and maintains a catalog of security tools designed to support deep technical testing of modern connected systems - especially those bridging digital and physical domains. Our tooling is built to uncover vulnerabilities in embedded systems, wireless protocols, mobile integrations, and edge devices. Need something specialized? Our engineers can adapt or extend our internal tools, and even yours, to integrate directly into your dev/test pipelines or support red/blue team operations inside your organization.

                At <span class="company-name nullptr small">nullptr</span>&nbsp;<span class="company-name security small">security</span>, we help companies proactively secure their products before attackers find the cracks. Whether you’re shipping access control hardware, IoT devices, firmware-heavy platforms, or customer-facing web/mobile apps, we offer comprehensive security audits - from full black box engagements to collaborative white box reviews. Our team brings experience from real-world offensive operations: reverse engineering complex devices, identifying 0-days, and building tooling that simulates advanced threat actors. We’ve worked with fintech companies, critical infrastructure vendors, and high-stakes communication platforms to find and fix issues before they became public problems. If your product controls access, handles sensitive data, or runs on a custom stack, we’ll help make sure it stands up to scrutiny.
